<center> <h3>About the Site</h3> </center>
   This site an Obsidian vault. It is split up into primarily a library, and a blog. Blog posts are a short discourse on a specific, small-scale project that is resolved and considered no longer ongoing. A library entry is a complete folder containing a much larger scale project where multiple updates and ongoing posts will occur. The media folder contains all media used throughout the site.

   Greetings! I am Arandor, a third-generation nerd who was sat down in front of a keyboard and mouse before he could talk. Most of my knowledge as a computer engineer comes from simply doing it as a hobby and teaching myself whatever I feel like. Granted, nothing much more than an excuse to goof off has come of my skills, but hopefully, someone else enjoys the chaos as much as I do.
   
   I've been wanting to set up a site for quite some time now, as it would provide a place to condense all of my thoughts and projects for people to read about. As such, this now exists. Enjoy!


   ***Be Warned:** This site will change often until I am settled with it's appearance.*
