## Introduction
Reactionary Measures is a mod that aims to add advanced nuclear engineering into Factorio, to power your hungry mods. It's design to flow easily with overhauls, separating itself into a contained ecosystem built upon vanilla resources. 

In order to be compatible with larger overhauls, no new ores are added. Only new recipes, items and buildings that are obtainable with base-game resources. 

Development of this project started in mid 2021, motivation to finish this undertaking has been lacking. 

Although I have taken a great deal of time to research and develop this mod, I am not a real nuclear scientist and have taken liberties in certain chemical reactions to spare players the burden of true realism. Expect a more in-depth but by no means true-to-life representation of nuclear physics. 

**Terms:**
	*Chain*
		A *chain* is a set of recipes that turn multiple ingredients into one or more desired outputs. The recipes can be spread across multiple buildings, and items may only be specific to one *chain*. There are several *chains* within RM, and they will be discussed in detail.

# 1 - Fission
### 1.1 - Basics of Fission
**1.1.1 - Introduction**
	Fission is defined as the splitting of an atom's nucleus, therein breaking apart the bonding energy of said atom, releasing energy and byproducts into the surrounding space. The amount of energy released from this fission is astronomically high, and is transferred in forms such as electromagnetic radiation and charged particles. 
**1.1.2 - Uses**
	Given such a significant source of energy, one would surmise that such release could be harnessed and put forth into useful work. 

### 1.2 Fluorine
**1.2.1 - Introduction**
	Fluorine and compounds that contain it are vital to the production of fissile uranium fuel.  
### 1.3 The Enriched Uranium Cell
**1.3.1 - Introduction**
	The production of fuel is the most vital step of a nuclear reactor. The EUCC chain is complex, however, much of the additional compounds that are used can be recycled back into the chain, for a closed-loop system. You only need add additional uranium ore.
**1.3.3 - Uranium Ore**
	Uranium ore must be leeched out from deposits using sulfuric acid. In this state it is impure UO2. Purifying and isotope enrichment is required to obtain usable fuel. This begins with fluorination, because UO2 is an ill-suited solid for enrichment.

	
0.0.0
	The enriched uranium cell chain (0.0.0a)(EUCC) is the first and most basic of chains that produces viable fuel for an MNR. EUCC produces a low-potency uranium fuel cell suitable for pressured water-cooled reactors.
