# Reactor
Plan how the reactor works.

**Buildings:**
- Reactor Ionization Chamber
- Reactor Control Rod Assembly
- Reactor Fuel Loader
- Reactor Calutron
- Reactor Housing
- Reactor Coolant Intake
- Reactor Coolant Outtake

****
## Creation 
Reactors are constructed around Ionization chambers, which have around them CRAs, Fuel Loaders, 


## Control
Input Reactor Fuel and Coolant, manage Control Rods and Xenon Pit

Iodine builds up proportional to the rate of fission and thermal power. 6.3% of every reaction turns into Xenon.  of that gets turned into Xenon which slows the reactor. 

If the power is lowered too much, the Xenon absorbs too many neutrons and disables the reactor. 

What do I want to do more?
