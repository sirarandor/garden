This mod does:
	want to have fun by being engaging, not boring
	provide a more structured power system
	provide excessive power after it's systems are in place
	end things very badly if mistakes happen
	try it's best to be side-loaded with other mods
	want to be completely deterministic. There is no variance or randomness, the same action will always lead to the same outcome. 
	base itself completely on vanilla factorio. No space age needed, but it does play nicely.
This mod does not:
	perfectly emulate realism
	want to waste time or resources for no reason
	provide a massive shift in factorio gameplay
	say it's created by a good programmer
