Water (as superheated steam) enters into the MNR. Exits as Mixed Isotope Water, a mixture of water that contains both regular, Deuterium, and Tritium.

### Modular Fission Reactor 
The fuel cell is a placeable block that has an inlet and outlet passage for coolant flow, on the north and south sides respectively. On the east and west sides are placed either control assemblies or breeding chambers. 

Within each fuel cell is calculated the fission of the fuel, both thermal and isotope products. As the fuel cell is used it depletes, until it must be removed, and a new one put in it's place. The old cells can have their actinide mixtures removed, and new fuel put into the cell through a recipe.

The breeder is interact-able with logistics bots. The

The fuel cell is moderated by the coolant and control rods. If the fuel cell generates more thermal energy than the coolant is capable of removing, the cell begins to take damage. If it is destroyed it will turn into fuel slag, damaging everything around it, and spewing massive amounts of pollution into the air. 

Ionization cores are constructed as 1x3 buildings. Supercritical carbon monoxide is passed through the core, and is heated up a specific amount. Placing cores in a line results in the coolant being heated to it's full thermal capacity.

Reminder that thermal heating is linear, and requires more energy in order to heat further. As the temperature of the sCO2 rises, the thermal efficiency of the Brayton turbine increases.

The pressure differential means that as the sCO2 rises in temperature, less sCO2 can be present in the same space. So, less sCO2 is released by the ionization core than taken in. 

The supercritical gas is then put through a bayer turbine, which releases more, cooler sCO2 than put in. 

Ionization cores must check the temperature of the incoming coolant and adjust their output accordingly. 

Ionization cores have a Xenon percentage that will kill the reaction if not managed.
### Fusion Tokamak 
The point of the tokamok is to create super-high-temperature plasma that allows for instant-smelting buildings
