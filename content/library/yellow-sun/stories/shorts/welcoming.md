Captain Kukula overlooked the bridge of her ship. At two kilometers in length, the *Idocanter* was on the more modest of ships within the Shining Star's fleet. Fitted for duty in war and relief, she was making her way to the Sol system as fast as her sublights would safely allow. 

Several months ago, the Council determined that the cluster of seed-ships headed towards Sol and by extension Sol-3 were merely "natures course", and that it would be ill-advised to interfere.

Every family of the Shining Star disagreed. Unanimously. To see a species die out, to watch them be slaughtered from afar without interference, was simply so absurd, so self-centered, that infighting turned to unity. And so, the Shining Star sent forth, shrouded behind legal paperwork, the *Idocanter*. With it, her scrupulous crew of 700, several hundred thousand tonnes of relief supplies, and enough ordinance to make a Council Interdictor blush. 

By the time they reached Sol-5, they had slowed from 0.2c down to 11km/s. By the time they reached Sol-4, the early warning systems were activating countermeasures to a threat not yet perceived by Captain Kulula's neurons. She watched as half the starboard hull erupted in a burst of light, as electromagnetic radiation sprayed across the leptonic field, turning the ship's magnetosphere into a dizzying light show. 

"All stop!" shouted Kukula, blinking away the dots in her eyes. "Wind blow us, I say all stop!"

The ship came to an abrupt stop, the gravity compensators working overtime to keep everyone and everything from flying away at thousands of meters per second. 

Her personal screen blared with alerts and warnings, briefing her immediately on what had struck the hull. The computer interpreted the measly three seconds of data it had gathered as best it could, displaying the most likely outcome. The  object was cylindrical in shape,  The inhabitants were not dead, not in need of help, and very very armed.
