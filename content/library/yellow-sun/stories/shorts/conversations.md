"They are paranoid"
"Thoughtful"

"What does MSPEC say?"
"Composed of... homogenous mineral."
"That makes it a rock 2 kilometers in diameter traveling at almost 0.2c. We can assume it was launched behind the other asteroids. Trajectory?"
"Intercepts with the moon in 23 hours."
"No, it won't."
"Aye sir."

"Sir, uh, MSPEC has been working with the Wave Array on Ceres, and uh, it's big, sir."
"What's big?"
"The boys, uh, identified seventy interstellar meteoroids, trajectory intercepts over half of our uh, occupied stations."
"Alright, what about Earth?"
"We're uh, worried most of them are going to intercept Earth. You see, uh, sir, the planets are, literally, aligned. Every celestial body with, uh, a station is in line, right down to, uh, Earth. Sir."
"Why isn't the moon catching them? Isn't that... what it does?"
"Uh, sir, yes sir. But, uh, there's a problem. Here. See, The trajectory, the moon is going to be right here, which doesn't help, uh, at all."
"So, what about atmosphere?"
"The asteroids, they uh, have, homogenous iron shells. All on average, uh, they're the same size."
"These are starting to sound a lot like missiles."
"That's uh, what we were thinking, sir."
"Aliens?"
"Potentially. That's, uh, the working theory, sir."
"Ok. Are we sure it's an attack, not a committee?"
"Uh, they're too small. We think. They uh, have heat signatures internally, uh, but no way to seemingly change direction. Uh, entirely gravity-driven. So far as we know."
"Has anyone attempted contact?"
"Yes, uh, sir. No response. Anything we could try. Light, Radio, every frequency we could generate, we shot at them from Ceres."
"So we're tracking seventy hot iron rocks that are about to hit every station and everyo inhabited planet?"
"Yes, uh, sir. They already struck Japeth on Iapetus. They're headings towards Ceres and it's, uh, sisters. No response from Japeth, uh, sir. We, uh, don't know what happened."
"Missiles. This reeks of meditated strike."
"That's, uh, yeah."
"Ok. We have a protocol for this. How many ODIs are online and facing the right way?"
"I think about seven installations, are ready uh, sir. Three or four more if we expedite."
"Oh, good. Great, actually. Go ahead and vaporize the missiles. I guess, the boys can study the rubble."
"Yes, uh, sir. Thank you, sir. Oh, uh, one more thing."
"Yes?"
"There's uh, another asteroid. Big one, sir, uh, real big. Not iron, some form of rock. Calcite, quartz. It's, uh, 2 kilometers in length, half that in diameter, uh about, sir."
"The mothership? Really?"
"We're, uh, not sure. It's hot, with uh, real hot spots on the back. See? It's catching up, about 2% the speed of light. Faster than the meteors."
"Will it reach us before the meteors?"
"No, uh, it'll be short, by, uh, about 23 hours."
"The mothership?"
"Maybe, uh, sir. You see, uh, sir. it's loud. Uh, every frequency, it's sending out uh, transmissions."
"What's it saying?"
"We're, uh, not sure. There's a lot of repeated audio, and data, uh, images, and uh, we think it's trying to surrender, or telling us to surrender. We don't uh, know."
"You know what? I'll get SNC to launch an intercept warhead. If they're smart, they'll shoot it down and stop. If they're dumb, they'll shoot it down and keep going. If that happens, we'll launch the rest."
"Thank you, uh, sir"
"I guess, report back if there's still a planet to report back to."
"Yes, uh, sir."

"Uh, sir, there's been a uh, update."
"Alright?"
"Sir, uh, that mothership? The big one?"
"Yeah?"
"Well, uh, sir, the warhead intercepted and was shot down. It's uh, stopped dead, 36 million miles short of Mars."
"Have we tried to contact it?"
"Yeah. Uh, that's why I'm here. The boys have been working to get communications with them."
"Them?"
"Yeah, uh, sir. Them. Aliens. They're smart, real smart, sir. They said, uh, they didn't launch the meteors. They want to help with, uh damages."
"The aliens? So, we just met two species at once? And one is trying to kill us, while the other one is trying to help?"
"Yes, uh, sir. Seems so."
"Huh. Ok, fishy. So, what now?"
"We're uh, trying to figure that out. They speak English. Real good, sir. They want to meet in person. They're not going to get any closer to Earth."
"Why am I involved, then? This is diplomacy. WIB should be handling this."
"The uh, world interface board is requesting your permission to assign three destroyers. As escorts. With the, uh, diplomatic ship. Can't be too careful."
"Done. Keep me updated. And, I want to meet Them."
"Yes sir."



"He was a CAPTAIN of a STARSHIP"
"He disobeyed a direct order from the GCC."
"He did not recognize your rulership."
"And he was punished accordingly."
"And you will be punished for attacking."
"Is that a threat to our juristdiction? The Galactic Council recognizes that the Galaxy is under complete control."
