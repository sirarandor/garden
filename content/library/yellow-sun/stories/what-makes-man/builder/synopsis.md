Dear Reader,
This universe burns slowly. I have built up pages of details in my head over the past years, and I intend to describe them in detail. No, seriously, the Obsidian project for the Yellow Sun universe lays in the megabytes. There will be paragraphs of discussion about science and nerdy math. I will include action, but there will also be men and women wearing suits at a conference table. Continue reading, if you dare.



What Makes Man is a 24,000 word story, which details the introduction of extra-planetary life to humans, changing their life as they know it. Set hundreds of years prior to the first expedition of The Frontier, technology is crude at best. While this could be considered the "first draft", every chapter will be released in a state I am comfortable with. 

It starts when a clump of seed-comets, carrying a hyper-aggresive carnivorous species, crashes into the various exterior bases and cities the humans have set up. Because of gravitational and spectrometry coordination, the seed-comets strike the system the precise time the planets of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Earth are aligned, aiming to attack and feed on as much organic matter. 

Through a long series of communication, they must identify all seed-comets and their landing patterns, and set up defenses accordingly. Scientists must study any matter retrieved to come up with optimal offensive countermeasures in the event of further interactions. The areas that have already been struck must defend themselves against the onslaught of creatures. 

Pressingly, the comets must be stopped at all costs before they strike Earth. The Earth has the proper defenses to destroy them, but the communication must be made. Much paperwork must be waded through to even get a communication to Earth. 

Because the asteroids are smaller than 100m in diameter, they are considered non-lethal meteors. So most earth defense systems disregard it. But they have organic carbon heat shielding, which MSPEC identified.

Inbetween all this, the story follows side-plots of humans trying to survive the creatures on the areas already taken.

Climax of the novel ends when the comets are destroyed, and the humans are greeted by a new alien species.
