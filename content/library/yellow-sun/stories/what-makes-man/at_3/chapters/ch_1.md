*Introduction*

Lt. John Evans was dreaming. Walking along a winding path, deep in the forests of Earth. Listening to sound of dirt under his boots, and trees swaying above his head. The sound of his wife, Mary, walking beside him. The feeling of her hand intertwined with his. The... sound of a buzzer. The sound he could hear, but not figure out where it was.

Specialist Linsey Haynes. Top 30th percentile of astronomic class. Notes from her employers marked her as capable, dependable, and willing to learn. She had transferred directly from her class on Ceres, to a Wave Array Station on Hygiea for experience. For most, entirely unrecognizable. But, right now, Specialist Linsey Haynes was white as snow. 

The terminal monitor beeped a two-tone, three note warning. Pleasant, but very insistent to inform her that the array received an emergency message from a known spacecraft. She had correctly aligned the array, and the analyst had done his job in parsing the input. 

The three people watching the terminal were also, not by coincidence, white as snow. The analyst leaned back in his chair, and Linsey swallowed. Both of them looked at the terminal monitor.

"Is it... real?" said the CSO, his voice unsure. "That could have been a mistake. Or a prank"

Linsey's mind fell back into her body at the sound. "No," she responded, shaking her head. "Broadcasting an Onset Protocol message requires included proof. It's not standalone. Look." Linsey tapped a button on the desk, splitting apart the message contents. 

Along with the initial message, was included a full black box. Every computer diagnostic output event, planned or unplanned course adjustment, even a copy of every array scan made by the spacecraft had been broadcast into the black. Decodable by any transceiver with an antenna.
