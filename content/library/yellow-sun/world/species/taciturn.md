Very little is truly known about The Taciturn. It is estimated that nearly 700 million years ago they inhabited nearly two out of every three planets in the Milky Way. However, their disappearance was sudden and silent, and the planets that once might have been theirs are now too extreme to support any life at all.

What can be gleamed of them is found deep with catacombs of these dangerous planets, revealing their intense love for science and pushing the boundary what is known to be physically possible. It is not known if they travelled to another galaxy, or even exited reality itself. 

The insights they provide of science often immediately have lasting effects on society. New chemicals and alloys are found, synthesized fuels that are hundreds of times more efficient.

The first and nearly the largest of these catacombs was found on the planet Venus, in the Sol system. Kept hidden by humans for many years. Quickly after their discovery, many other catacombs were found, often in a species' home system.

It was found that all systems with intelligent life that had a Taciturn catacomb shared exactly the same DNA sequence for neurons that are found in BA10, as well as many other sequences (Compare Humans and Iubis). One theory suggests that the Taciturn planted this DNA sequence across hundreds of species, to either preserve or give sapience.
