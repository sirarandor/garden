## Introduction
 The Fenyk are large, octopedal organisms that live in high-pressure, low temperature methane atmospheres found on small moons and planets far from suns. They have a double-layer azotosome outer membrane, oil-slick rainbow sheen against their obsidian body. Their skeleton is comprised of hollow organosilicon-carbon tubes, which are filled with cells that aid their body. Their blood is primarily liquid ethane, carrying monomers that aid in repairs for their cyanoacetylene piezeo-needle muscles. Their ligaments are made from tholin-cyanide, lubricated by ethane weepage from their blood. Their four arms end in two-thumbed, two-fingered, polycyanogen-clawed hands, accompanied by soft tholin pads. 

Their eyes see infrared light, at a frequency where the methane becomes invisible. Their eyes are large, circular, and grey, with no pupil. 

Fenyks grow extremely slowly, because they require an abundance of exotic materials. This makes them hyper-carnivores in their world, harvesting already processed organic matter to aid their growth. Children are treated as sacred to them, and their population has always been low.

They are among the greatest space-fairing race in the galaxy. Fenyk craft are made of sleek, elegant crafts formed from ice and polyethelyne wool, making them shine like blue topaz.
