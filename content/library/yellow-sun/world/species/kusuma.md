These creatures come from plants. They are the most prolific and widespread out of all the species, dominating the galaxy as a whole. Because of their basal origins, they do not require sleep nor extensive nutrients. Only dormant periods of reduced strain, so their bodies can rebuild what was damaged. They do however require light from stars, as they do photosynthesize 

Their brains and organs have no specific origin, being spread throughout their body, with more being grown when needed.

They continually grow, becoming larger and more intelligent with age. They have no "mature" stage, always capable of learning and becoming new. Functionally immortal, they do however become increasingly unstable with age, and diseases have better chances of spreading the larger they become. 

They are self-preserving by nature, but this is not to say they are outright selfish. They can have lasting relationships with other sapient organisms, as the connection is viewed as mutually symbiotic. However, certain members can be very paranoid or cold-hearted, leading them to be dangerous sociopaths. The longer a member lives, the more closed-off they will become, prideful of their own size and wisdom.

Younger members are easily impressed upon, as curiosity comes with age. Thus, it is easy for one member to influence the next generation.
