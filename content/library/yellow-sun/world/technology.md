### Domain Fusion Drive
DFDs are self-contained wormhole-creating devices that tune the electromagnetic output of a fusion torus to decay the graviton mode into ghost-condensate pairs within a Buckminster-Fuller style geodesic sphere around the craft. Each triangular face of the sphere allows for the vacuum to phase-transition into ghost condensate, which allows a negative-energy torus to form and


# Human
### Overview
Humanity has excellent sensors and tracking systems that rival that of many species, but they don't have the ability to create large or numerous vessels due to their lack of supermassive shipyards, simply because they haven't been space-worthy for long enough. Aside from space-to-space torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads, or railgun installations in orbit around planets, they do not have the advanced armory that other species have. They have very basic leptonic shields, only designed to counteract cosmic radiation. 
### Spacecraft
Humanity's spacecraft are egregiously function over form. Cylinders of a light non-reflective alloy, wrapped in steel support beams, with huge thrusters on one end. Power generation is crude but robust, sealed lead-cooled fission reactors provide abundant amounts of heat to utilize in turbines. Considered cramped and ugly by galactic standards, they do their job well enough.

### Sensors
Humans utilize laser and radar sensors, each different forms of electromagnetic sensors.
### The KrichHoff Installation

All matter emits electromagnetic radiation on some level. Which means, all matter can be measured and viewed passively. Humanity recognized this, and exploited the law to construct a device capable of passively detecting radiation emitted with energy as low as ~1Ev. The device, known as the KHI, is a large dish on the surface of Luna, made of compacted slabs which in turn are comprised of the highly reflected material found there. Radiation is deflected into a center point, the iris. As radiation enters the iris, it passes through a special Hohlraum lens, breaks the covalent bond of the silicon transistors, causing them to become inactive. The shape in which the transistors break matches whatever has emitted the energy. Unfortunately, the KHI is so delicate and long-range, that it cannot find objects by randomly scouting.


# Iuba
### Overview


### Spacecraft 
Simply put, Iubis ships are grandiose, utilizing a mineral compound called Qerhet mined in abundance from asteroids. First, a metal alloy grid from the skeleton of the ship. Then, a Qerhet shell would be formed like clay around the skeleton, molded by huge robotic arms. The outer shell would be hardened from exposure to the radiation from their sun, making it quite literally rock-solid. 

The Qerhet shell allowed for intricate exterior designs, and the method of construction allowed Iubis spacecraft to be as large as desired. It's not rare to see an Iubis spacecraft weigh in the millions of tonnes and kilometers in length.
